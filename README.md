# turtlesim_echokinesis
Hello there!
In this mini-project, I have used custom rosservice client to copy the movement of the first spawned turtle

### Problem statement
The problem statement that I took to myself was to write a code to make a new spawned turtle copy the velocity of the first spawned turtle if a new running node which gives boolean output(i.e, if the answer is ***True***, it will copy the previous turtle's velocity) 

> I will try to upload the screen recording of the execution in further commits
